                </div>

                <p>The Mixing Bowl is a community-run café, kitchen and garden concept which provides those
                    who need it
                    with access to nutritious, tasty food and a communal space to cook in, learn in and have fun in.</p>

            <div class="project-intro-2">
                <p></p>
                <p>The Trussell Trust have reported a 73% increase in food bank usage from 2014 to 2019, an increase
                    that shows no sign of abating. I created this project informed by the anger I felt about the levels
                    of food poverty in the UK and how those who work tirelessly at food banks seem to be fighting an
                    increasingly losing battle.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="head-img">

            </div>

            <div class="project-text-centre">
                <p>Examining the manifold problems associated with reliance on food banks, my research centred on the
                    failings of the current system and how new grassroots projects could help plug the gaps left by the
                    government.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="project-text-1">
                <p>1. There is a stigma attached to receiving help from food banks, with many people feeling too ashamed
                    to go. It is estimated that only 1 in 5 of those who have trouble accessing food go to food banks
                    for help.
                </p>
                <p>2. Almost all food provided is tinned or long life, which means that those who rely on food banks
                    receive no fresh food, such as fruit or vegetables.
                </p>
                <p>3. Emergency packages are tightly rationed and are often made up of the cheapest available products,
                    leading to diets which are high in sugar, fat and salt and low on the necessary vitamins and
                    minerals.
                </p>
                <p> 4. Many who cannot afford to buy food also do not have access to gas or electricity, so are left
                    with raw, cold food which they have no way of cooking.
                </p>
                <p> 5. Food bank users are routinely given a collection of food products with no advice on how best to
                    cook them, so are further unable to make best use of the food they have received. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-text-2">
                <p>It is clear that the solution to this nuanced, complex problem must be nuanced itself. It must be:
                </p>
                <p>1. Multi-faceted: aimed at solving problems from a variety of angles.
                </p>
                <p>2. Grass-roots driven: fostering an active community can help provide solutions before political
                    change is implemented.
                </p>
                <p> 3. Political: whilst grass-roots action is crucial, policy change from government is the only thing
                    which will fundamentally change food poverty.
                </p>
                <p> 4. Sustainable: for lasting effect, it must provide food education and transferable skills.
                </p>
                <p> 5. Accessible: it must be as easy as possible to access the services or to make donations.
                </p>
                <p> 6. Community-focused: it must foster a positive community creating a humanising, rather than
                    degrading, process.
                </p>
                <p> 7. Focused on joy: an opposing force to the mental distress of struggling to access food, the space
                    must function as a place where food can be a source of happiness again. </p>

                <p>The space is open and invites in those who need access to food and cooking resources, those who want

                    space in which to explore food.

                <p>
                    This helps to create an active community where those who struggle with accessing food do not feel

                <p>The Mixing Bowl can provide access to fresh food, which can be grown in the community gardens or
                    donated and stored. Rather than existing separately to the local community and waiting for
                    donations, it uses an outreach programme to connect to businesses and individuals who are able to
                    make regular donations.</p>

            <div class="project-text-2">
                <p>By garnering the support of local food businesses, the Mixing Bowl can also provide food education to
                    its audience with interactive classes, joint cooking sessions and literature to take home. The space
                    also functions as a hub for political and social activism, where people who often feel excluded from
                    the political conversation can have their voices heard. It has a multi-faceted approach which helps
                    to combat many of the interlinked problems people face when they are unable to access food.</p>
