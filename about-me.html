                <span class="para-intro">I'm Ella Marke</span> a graphic designer and copywriter who
                is passionate about design which helps to make the world a better place.
                I love exploring the intersections of design, society and history in order to
                create rich, concept-focused solutions which are conscious of their context and
                relationship with their audience.
            </p>

            <p> I particuarly love working with projects which involve <em>branding,
                    web design,
                    theatre design, food industry, editorial layout</em>. But this certainly doesn’t mean
                I’m not interested in other projects—tell me about what you need and I’ll tell
                you what I can do about it.
            </p>

        <div class="research-description">
            <p>
                <span class="para-intro">I use a rich, research-led process.</span> It’s important
                to me that all the work I produce doesn’t just look
                great, but comes from a <em>smart concept led by loads of
                    contextual research.</em> If you want to see case studies of
                how I’ve applied research to my work in the past,
                <span class="inline-link"><a href="my-work.html">take a look over here.</a></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The way I work changes project to project, but it generally fits within
                a specifc structure which I’ve found leads to the most interesting and
                thoughtful outcomes.

        <p><em>Understanding the brief</em>. Some projects will have detailed briefs from the get-go,
            with all the information I’ll need to get started. Other times, there may not be
            a written brief at all—just a problem that needs to be solved. Either way, at this
            stage I’ll work through the problem and get to the bottom of exactly what the goals
            of this project will be. This includes looking at timescales, deliverables and
            pricing.</p>

        <p><em>Beginning research.</em> Whilst I keep up research throughout the length of the project,
            the bulk of it comes at this stage. Although this varies depending on the type of
            project and its scope, I tend to break down my research into different sections,
            some which may be more relevant than others in different projects:</p>

        <p><em>Historical / socio-political / aesthetic / commercial.</em></p>

            <em>Concept creation.</em> At this stage, I’ll begin to formalise different
            concepts and approaches that would work to solve your design problem.
            This normally means rough sketches and some explanation of my thinking.
            It gives us a chance to work together to create a soloution that’s going to
            look beautiful and work beautifully.
