            <p>
                <span class="para-intro">I love creating design which makes the world a better place.</span> All
                projects can have a positive impact, no matter how small. Whether it's marketing design which
                encourages a new audience to <span class="inline-link"><a href="nuns.html">get excited by theatre</a></span>, branding that helps connect black business
                owners with new communities or discovering radical new ways to <span class="inline-link"><a href="mixing-bowl.html">tackle food poverty</a></span>, many of my
                projects question how design can make a difference.
            </p>

            <p> I particularly love working with projects which involve <em>branding,
                    web design,
                    theatre marketing, the food industry, and lifestyle products</em>. But this certainly doesn't mean
                I'm not interested in other projects—tell me about what you need and I'll tell
                you what I can do about it.

            <p>
                <span class="para-intro">I use a rich, research-led process.</span> It's important
                to me that all the work I produce doesn't just look
                great, but comes from a <em>smart concept led by loads of
                    contextual research.</em> If you want to see case studies of
                how I've applied research to my work in the past,
                <span class="inline-link"><a href="my-work.html">take a look over here.</a></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The way I work changes project to project, but it generally fits within
                a specific structure which I've found leads to the most interesting and
                thoughtful outcomes.

            <p><em>Understanding the brief</em>. Some projects will have detailed briefs from the get-go,
                with all the information I'll need to get started. Other times, there may not be
                a written brief at all—just a problem that needs to be solved. Either way, at this
                stage I'll work through the problem and get to the bottom of exactly what the goals
                of this project will be. This includes looking at timescales, deliverables and
                pricing.</p>

            <p><em>Beginning research.</em> Whilst I keep up research throughout the length of the project,
                the bulk of it comes at this stage. Although this varies depending on the type of
                project and its scope, I tend to break down my research into different sections,
                some which may be more relevant than others in different projects:</p>

            <p><em>Historical / socio-political / aesthetic / commercial.</em></p>

                <em>Concept creation.</em> At this stage, I'll begin to formalise different
                concepts and approaches that would work to solve your design problem.
                This normally means rough sketches and some explanation of my thinking.
                It gives us a chance to work together to create a solution that's going to
                look beautiful and work beautifully.

                making the idea we visualised a reality, sending you updates along the way.
                This is when things start looking like the final product.

                I have so far and we can discuss any changes you might want made.
