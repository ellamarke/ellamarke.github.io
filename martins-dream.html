                <p>Systemic and institutionalised racism persists because the people with the power to change it either
                    don’t care enough or care very much about those systems staying in place. </p>

                <p>This campaign seeks to educate its audience about the very real effects of racism in society – to
                    make people feel uncomfortable in continuing their pattern of apathy whilst aware of racial
                    injustices.

                <p>The campaign uses the phrase ‘Who Killed Martin's Dream?' (referencing Martin Luther King Jr's I
                    Have
                    a Dream speech) as an urgent and pressing slogan
                    to emphasise how the dreams of the civil rights era
                    have been lost to a system which still oppresses people
                    of colour.</p>

                <p>The typeface and infographics are formed out of dead, shrivelled petals, at once reflecting death and
                    also a sense of hope. By using flowers and saturated colours, the campaign visuals reflect the
                    aesthetic of mid-century civil rights posters which drew on an intense need for hope amongst the
                    anger, frustration and sorrow. </p>

                <p>With education at the heart of the campaign, finding new ways of understanding complex data and
                    socio-economic politics was crucial. A short book explores the current position of African
                    Americans through the lens of the original ten-point programme of the Black Panther Party published
                    in the 1960s. </p>

            <div class="project-text-2">
                <p>In which ways have these demands for human rights been fulfilled? In which ways have civil rights
                    processes remained stagnant or even reverted since the mid-century? Spoiler: not a huge amount has
                    changed — in fact, not one of the original ten demands have been fulfilled. With economic inequality
                    deeply entrenched in American society, racial equality is still desperately far away. </p>
